"One way to enforce TLSv1.2 support would be to configure the f-droid.org "

"versions of F-Droid and old devices without TLSv1.2 (added in Android 4.1) "

"\"Bus factor\" is an important measure of the health of a free software "
"project, even though the idea is quite morbid.  As F-Droid has expanded from "
"a project of one to a whole community effort. And there is much more work "
"than one person can do.  Essential infrastructure needs to be maintained by "
"separate people to make the whole project resilient and owned by the "

"calyxinstitute.org/) in Iceland.  It is hard to find a better combination "
"for a project that is concerned with privacy.  Nick is an F-Droid user, and "
"Calyx Institute is building the most private internet services possible, "
"with F-Droid as a key piece.  Nick also fought a secret order from the US "
"government and [won in US Federal Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doe_v."

"F-Droid is a robot with a passion for Free and Open Source (FOSS)  software, "

"them. One key goal was to make it possible for people to contribute to the "
"app reviews, even if they are not an Android developer in any way, shape, or "
"form.  This is possible by making _issuebot_ run as many of the core build "
"processes and review tools automatically, then _issuebot_ presents that "
"information as a response in the thread of the RFP issue or _fdroiddata_ "
"merge request.  We brainstormed a number of ways to present this "
"information, and decided the best place to integrate _issuebot_ was into the "
"existing workflow where F-Droid contributors and community members work on "
"reviewing apps: the GitLab projects.  There are always uses for this "
"information that we did not anticipate, and the data was already being "

"Anyone can submit a \"request for packaging\" (RFP) or app merge request to "
"F-Droid.  The basic user experience is familiar to most internet users since "
"it is built around a user account and a form to submit text.  This means "
"that the RFP issue tracker has less technical users.  Given the relative "
"simplicity of _issuebot_, the goal had to be to help reviewers communicate "
"to submitters.  Technical submitters will be able to follow the _issuebot_ "
"posts, and in other cases, F-Droid contributors can point non-technical "
"submitters to information in the _issuebot_ reports in order to highlight "
"problems.  As long as they provide a link to a source code repository or an "
"Android APK app file, _issuebot_ can provide useful reviews on its own.  It "
"also presents lots of information to make the human reviewer's job a lot "
"easier.  There are RFP issues, and the submitted apps can contain a wide "
"variety of technological approaches and coding environments.  No reviewer "
"has all of those skills, so it is important for reviewers to be able to "
"quickly find submissions that they will feel qualified to review.  Also, "
"there are many things that _issuebot_ can automaticaly detect.  Therefore, "
"we built a system of colored labels for _issuebot_ to add to every "
"submission.  From these labels, a reviewer can quickly select the platform "
"they are familiar with, e.g. Flutter.  They can also see whether a "
"submission has clear problems that likely disqualify it, like requiring "
"proprietary libraries or known tracking services."

"fdroidserver/__init__.py).  This allows for a wide range of new uses, like "
"[headless, automated repos](https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/wind-repo/-/"
"blob/master/scripts/fdroid-update-ersatz.py)  or [_issuebot_](https://gitlab."
"com/fdroid/issuebot/-/blob/master/issuebot.py).  It is now also possible to "
"extend the command line interface using the new [plugins](https://gitlab.com/"
"fdroid/fdroidserver/-/blob/master/examples/fdroid_fetchsrclibs.py).  The app "
"metadata files are now purely [YAML]({{ site.baseurl }}/{% post_url "
"2019-09-11-yaml-metadata %}), so they are an API in themselves, easily "
"parsable and writeable by any standard YAML library.  Also, the preferred "
"format for the repo config file is now YAML (_config.yml_)."

"users if they want Tor, then walk them through the install process.  When "
"push requests was implemented, there were not ROM projects that were "
"embedding F-Droid.  Now its clearly better to include Tor as part of the ROM "
"rather than via push requests.  CalyxOS's [Setup Wizard](https://gitlab.com/"

"- Most open-source apps are developed by volunteers in their free time. In "
"order to spend time on open-source app development as an actual part-time "
"job, developers need a source of income. Only a tiny fraction of developers "
"can actually live off the donations they receive. We discussed everyone's "
"experiences with receiving donations. An important aspect is that recurring "
"(small) donations are a lot more helpful than infrequent (large) donations "
"because it makes it easier to plan. We talked about how it would be possible "
"to ask users for donations without getting annoying. F-Droid already stores "
"donation links in the app metadata and displays them on the client's app "
"details page. The problem with this is that after downloading, the app "
"details page is no longer actively used. We agreed that it would be great to "
"ask for donations on the \"updates\" tab of the F-Droid client: when an app "
"has been installed for a long time, the client could ask if you want to "
"donate to keep the app development sustainable. The \"updates\" tab has "
"already been prepared for this kind of messages, but it still needs a "
"developer to implement the last pieces.  - Many F-Droid users run rather old "
"Android devices. A possible reason is that they care about the environment "
"and do not want to throw away working devices. In order to still support old "
"Android versions, app developers have to invest a significant amount of "
"work. One example is that [supporting HTTPS connections on old Android "
"versions is hard](https://f-droid.org/2020/05/29/android-updates-and-tls-"
"connections.html). HTTPS connections not only affect Browser applications, "
"but also apps like weather forecast apps or podcast players. While it would "
"be possible that each app shipped the necessary code to connect to modern "
"HTTPS servers, that would increase the size of each app by about 4 MB. There "
"have already been ideas on how to only have one app ship the HTTPS code and "
"have it loaded from there into other apps. The main missing point was which "
"app would be trustworthy enough to ship such security critical code. We "
"discussed that including it in the F-Droid client is not a good idea because "
"the app is already rather complex. Given that both devices running Google "
"Services and devices running [microG](https://microg.org/) already have a "
"provider for that code, we decided that we should just write an open-source "
"library that talks to that system component. Therefore, the library would "
"basically be an open-source re-implementation of Google's ProviderInstaller, "
"calling the [same system APIs](https://github.com/microg/GmsCore/blob/"
"cb3592688b098e5a1870006797be665e3b083f3e/play-services-conscrypt-provider-"
"core/src/main/java/com/google/android/gms/common/security/"
"ProviderInstallerImpl.java#L72).  - Seldom, there are takedown requests for "
"apps on F-Droid, for example because of copyright claims. Often it is then "
"hard to contact the app authors. Some apps use git repositories without an "
"issue tracker and the contact email address is not actively requested when "
"adding a new app to the F-Droid repo. We discussed having a custom field in "
"the apps' metadata that could store a contact email address.  - Some apps "
"make strong use of different build flavors. Build flavors are different "
"versions of the same app, sharing most of the source code. F-Droid supports "
"specifying the build flavor to use when publishing an app, but it has "
"trouble with the metadata like screenshots and app description. We discussed "
"ways how to deal with that problem.  - An issue that frequently affects app "
"developers is that updating apps on F-Droid takes pretty much time. The "
"build server first has to compile the apps' source code. Then, the apps are "
"manually signed on a computer that is not connected to the internet. A "
"method that app developers can use to deal with that is to use reproducible "
"builds. With reproducible builds, F-Droid distributes the apps with the "
"original developer's signature. That way, users can switch between F-Droid's "
"version of an app and the developer's version of an app without having to re-"
"install. App developers can then publish critical updates on their website, "
"from inside the app or in their own F-Droid repository and users can still "
"update the app directly -- even if they originally installed it from F-Droid."
