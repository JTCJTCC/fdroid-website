# Languages are manually chosen by looking at languages that are fully
# translated across the whole project. Check with this script:
#   ./tools/check-language-status.sh
languages: [ "bo", "en", "de", "es", "fr", "tr", "zh_Hans", "zh_Hant" ]
# Specifying the default language as "_" forces polyglot to generate a
# en/ subdirectory too (with correct links). See
# https://github.com/untra/polyglot/issues/60
