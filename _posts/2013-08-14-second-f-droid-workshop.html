<li><strong>Where?</strong> Büro 2.0 (<a href="http://www.buero20.org/anfahrt">http://www.buero20.org/anfahrt</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Who?</strong> Daniel Martí – F-Droid developer</li>
</ul>
<p>The workshop is aimed at developers and advanced users – if you know how to use the terminal on a GNU/Linux machine you’re probably good to go. The only requirements for the workshop are basic technical skills on a GNU/Linux environment, including basic knowledge of the shell and the Git VCS.</p>

<p>The event will be split into two parts: First, there will be a presentation explaining the basics about F-Droid and how it works. After that, we’ll head on to the hands-on workshop, where everyone will be welcome to include new apps, update existing ones, improve the client and more!</p>
<p>Apart from your Android device, you should also bring a laptop if you have one. It will be easier to participate in the workshop if you have your own computer.</p>
