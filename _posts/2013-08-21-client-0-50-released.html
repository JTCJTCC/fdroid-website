<p>The latest release of the F-Droid Repository Client, version 0.50, is now available. You can download it from the home page or, if you already have an earlier version installed, just update.</p>
<p>Main changes since 0.46:</p>
<ul>
<li>New basic app sharing functionality.</li>
<li>Handle f-droid.org web repo as well as market:// app uris.</li>
<li>Search by just typing on main screen and search results screen.</li>
<li>Flattr and Bitcoin donation methods added.</li>
<li>Noticeable speedups when returning from installs and uninstalls.</li>
<li>Add back to home buttons to the ActionBar.</li>
<li>The client will no longer recommend versions newer than the current or incompatible with the device.</li>
<li>Switched to using standard Android locations for cached files rather than the .fdroid directory on the SD card.</li>
<li>Fix for crash at boot time where the SD card was slow to initialise (bug introduced in 0.46)</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes.</li>
<li>Lots of translation updates.</li>
</ul>
