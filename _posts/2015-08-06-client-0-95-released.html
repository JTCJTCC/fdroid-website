<p>The latest release of the F-Droid Repository Client, version 0.95, is now available. You can download it from the home page or, if you already have an earlier version installed, just update.</p>
<p>Main changes since 0.92:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start porting UI to Material Design, including a new launcher icon</li>
<li>Add support for app changelog links, which will appear for apps that have them once the repositories have been updated again</li>
<li>Redesign the App Details view with larger icons, expandable description and links with icons</li>
<li>Add ability to make F-Droid install itself as a privileged app on /system via root, allowing the use of the system installer</li>
<li>Remove the root installer, since the system installer is safer, more stable and now easy to set up with root privileges</li>
<li>Speed up and simplify repo update process by streaming the data out of the jar file directly</li>
<li>Can now manually add swap repo via “Repositories” screen</li>
<li>Using NFC during swap now initiates a proper swap, rather than redirecting to the “Repositories” screen</li>
</ul>
