<p>The latest release of the F-Droid Repository Client, version 0.88, is now available. You can download it from the home page or, if you already have an earlier version installed, just update.</p>
<p>Main changes since 0.83:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show list of apps in the update notification (on devices with Android 4.1 or higher)</li>
<li>User interface language can now be changed from inside the F-Droid preferences without changing the system language (locale)</li>
<li>Fix an issue where xml files could pile up in the data directory</li>
<li>Improve app and search link handling while also adding supporting for Amazon and Google Play links</li>
<li>Fix regression where F-Droid web repo links would trigger an “Add new repo” action</li>
<li>Show a message to the user when there are no apps to display.</li>
<li>Swapping is now two way. Connecting to a swap on one device will initiate a swap on the other device.</li>
<li>Small UI fixes to avoid overlapping text and improve app version ellipsizing.</li>
<li>Split up search terms when querying the app database – “fire fox” now matches FireFox</li>
<li>Ignore trailing paces in search terms introduced by some input methods</li>
<li>Fixed bug where categories were always empty on non-English locales</li>
<li>Misc fixes to the “swap” workflow (especially on Android 2.3 devices)</li>
</ul>
