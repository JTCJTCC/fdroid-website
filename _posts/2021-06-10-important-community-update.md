Hello all,

Given recent events, the F-Droid team has decided to migrate from Freenode to OFTC. We chose OFTC because several projects the F-Droid team is closely aligned to (such as Debian and Tor) have already been using OFTC for many years.

This decision does not come easy to us, given the #fdroid channel was registered over 10 years ago (November 6th, 2010) on Freenode and has been extremely helpful in allowing our community to stay in touch.

If you are currently in #fdroid or #fdroid-dev on freenode, we suggest switching to #fdroid or #froid-dev on OFTC. The [OFTC website](https://oftc.net/) contains instructions on how to connect to the OFTC server.

If you are currently using the #fdroid-official:matrix.org or #fdroid-dev:matrix.org Matrix channels, you do not have to take any further action.

Please note that we are currently working on bridging the Matrix and OFTC channels. While the F-Droid dev chat is already bridged, we are still working with OFTC to be able to bridge the regular F-Droid chat.

We hope to see you there and thank you for your patience.
