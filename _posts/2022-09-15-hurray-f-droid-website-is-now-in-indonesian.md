title: Hurray, the F-Droid website is now in Indonesian!
---

The F-Droid website gives you access to various free software applications without the fear of losing your privacy or data; making it available in Indonesian is important for making free software widely used by the people of Indonesia.

Thanks to the volunteers who made Indonesian support available for the F-Droid website, documentation and application descriptions.  There is still room for improvements though, so if you are interested in helping with translating F-Droid, you can [click here to contribute](https://hosted.weblate.org/languages/id/f-droid/).

You can also support F-Droid by [making a donation]({{ site.baseurl }}/donate/) or if you have skills like coding or design, you can help F-Droid grow and improve by joining the mailing list or [checking issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/fdroid/-/issues/?sort=updated_desc&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=help-wanted) on our GitLab.

Thank you :)
