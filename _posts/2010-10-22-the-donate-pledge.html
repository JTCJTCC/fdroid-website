<p>A while back I read about the <a href="http://www.androidguys.com/2010/07/02/paid-app-pledge/">Paid App Pledge</a> over at Android Guys. I didn’t want to sign up to that – the last thing I want to do is encourage more hidden source code.</p>
<p>The intention is a good one though – encouraging more high quality software on the Android platform. Not that I think there’s a shortage of it, but more is better.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here’s my alternative pledge:</p>
<p>Any time I can afford to do so, I’ll take a look at the FOSS apps I’m using on my phone that I haven’t donated to yet. Then I’ll make a donation to the one I use most.</p>
<p>As well as financial donations I’ll make the effort to contribute in other ways too. That can include reporting bugs, suggesting features, or contributing code. Everything helps.</p>
<p>Care to join me?</p>
