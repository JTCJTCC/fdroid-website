<p>The latest release of the F-Droid Repository Client, version 0.63, is now available. You can download it from the home page or, if you already have an earlier version installed, just update.</p>
<p>Main changes since 0.58:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for Network Service Discovery of local FDroid repos on Android 4.1+ from the repository management screen</li>
<li>Always remember the selected category in the list of apps</li>
<li>Send FDroid via Bluetooth to any device that supports receiving APKs via Bluetooth (stock Android blocks APKs, most ROMs allow them)</li>
<li>NFC support: beam repo configs from the repo detail view (Android 4.0+), beam the FDroid.apk from FDroidâ€™s main screen (Android 4.1+)</li>
<li>Support for repositories using self-signed HTTPS certificates through a Trust-on-first-use popup</li>
<li>Support for TLS Subject-Public-Key-Identifier pinning</li>
<li>Add native Right-to-Left support on devices running 4.2 and later</li>
<li>Filter app compatibility by maxSdkVersion too</li>
<li>Major internal changes to enable F-Droid to handle repos with thousands of apps without slowing down too much. These internal changes will also make new features easier to implement.<br/>
Lots of translation updates.</li>
</ul>
