<ul>
<li>Applications that are incompatible with your device (e.g. requiring a different Android version, or hardware you donâ€™t have) can now be filtered from the lists.</li>
<li>Applications that require root privileges can be filtered from the lists.</li>
<li>Various translation updates.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have problems or feature requests, talk to the <a href="http://f-droid.org/repository/issues">issue tracker</a> or visit #fdroid on FreeNode.</p>
