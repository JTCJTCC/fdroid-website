<p>The latest release of the F-Droid Repository Client, version 0.92, is now available. You can download it from the home page or, if you already have an earlier version installed, just update.</p>
<p>Main changes since 0.91:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make swap only in portrait mode to prevent crashes and issues where UI elements are obscured</li>
<li>Update Universal-Image-Loader to 1.9.4</li>
<li>Make Apk downloads progress be measured in kilobytes instead of bytes</li>
<li>Add missing Sardinian language to the preferences</li>
<li>Fix minimum SDK to be 8 (2.2) instead of 7 (2.1) since support for version 7 was dropped long ago</li>
</ul>
