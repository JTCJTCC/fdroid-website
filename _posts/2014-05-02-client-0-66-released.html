<p>The latest release of the F-Droid Repository Client, version 0.66, is now available. You can download it from the home page or, if you already have an earlier version installed, just update.</p>
<p>Main changes since 0.63:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash on startup for devices with more than 500 installed apps, and improved performance for devices with many installed apps.</li>
<li>Added the ability to send apps to other devices directly from the App Details screen via NFC or Bluetooth.</li>
<li>Improved app list layouts.</li>
<li>Keep track of installed apps internally, rather than asking Android each time.</li>
<li>Fixed update notification problems.</li>
<li>Security fixes and updates for adding of repos.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug introduced in 0.63 which made F-Droid always omit density-specific icons, making icons blurry on high-res devices.</li>
<li>Fixed some other crashes.</li>
<li>Translation updates, and category lists are now translatable.</li>
</ul>
