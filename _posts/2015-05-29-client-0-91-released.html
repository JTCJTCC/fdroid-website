<p>The latest release of the F-Droid Repository Client, version 0.91, is now available. You can download it from the home page or, if you already have an earlier version installed, just update.</p>
<p>Main changes since 0.88:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t request the “Write to external storage” permission on 4.4 and later since it’s not needed to use our own external app directory</li>
<li>Fix a crash occuring if the user triggered a repo update that got rid of more than 450 apks at once</li>
<li>Properly cache apk files on the SD card if configured this way</li>
<li>Drop support for unsigned repos in favour of signed ones and TOFU support</li>
<li>Provide better feedback when adding repos with same name of existing repo</li>
<li>Add support for special Google Play search terms like “pub:” and “pname:”</li>
<li>Fix regression where adding repos via URLs would not actually add a new repo</li>
<li>Normalize and check URLs of repos being added</li>
<li>Don’t crash if links on descriptions cannot be handled by any application</li>
<li>Support building as part of a ROM via an Android.mk using gradle</li>
</ul>
