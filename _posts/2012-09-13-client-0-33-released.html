<ul>
<li>Update notifications take you straight to the updates tab.</li>
<li>Various performance improvements for slow devices. (More of these to come in the next release)</li>
<li>More efficient memory usage when updating.</li>
<li>Fixed occasional random crashes caused by database locks.</li>
<li>Packages for the same app from multiple repos are merged, rather than one repo taking priority.</li>

</ul>
