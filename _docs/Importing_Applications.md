To help with starting work on including a new application, use
`fdroid import` to set up a new template project. It has two modes of
operation, starting with a cloned git repo:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient
cd fdroidclient
fdroid import
```

Or starting with a URL to a project page:

```
fdroid import --url=http://address.of.project
```

When a URL is specified using the `--url=` flag, `fdroid import` will
use that URL to find out information about the project, and if it finds
a git repo, it will also clone that. For this to work, the URL must
point to a project format that the script understands. Currently this is
limited to one of the following:

1.  GitLab - `https://gitlab.com/PROJECTNAME/REPONAME`
2.  Gitorious - `https://gitorious.org/PROJECTNAME/REPONAME`
3.  Github - `https://github.com/USER/PROJECT`
4.  Google Code - `http://code.google.com/p/PROJECT/` Supports git, svn
    and hg repos.

    Some Google Code projects have multiple repositories, identified by
    a dropdown list on the `source/checkout` page. To access one other
    than the default, specify its name using the `--repo` switch.

5.  Bitbucket - `https://bitbucket.org/USER/PROJECT/`
6.  Git - `git://REPO`

Depending on the project type, more or less information may be gathered.
For example, the license will be retrieved from a Google Code project,
but not a GitHub one. A bare repo url, such as the git:// one, is the
least preferable optional of all, since you will have to enter much more
information manually.

If the import is successful, a metadata file will be created. You will
need to edit this further to check the information, and fill in the
blanks.

If it fails, youâ€™ll be told why. If it got as far as retrieving the
source code, you can inspect it further by looking in `tmp/importer`
where a full checkout will exist.

A frequent cause of initial failure is that the project directory is
actually a subdirectory in the repository. In this case, run the
importer again using the `--subdir` option to tell it where. It will not
attempt to determine this automatically, since there may be several
options.
