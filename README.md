# Website of F-Droid.org

This website will going to be used on [F-Droid.org](https://f-droid.org).
It is based on Jekyll and you can find the development version
[here](https://fdroid.gitlab.io/fdroid-website/).

## Building with Jekyll

To build the website, you need to have Jekyll 3.0+ installed.
With Ubuntu 16.04 and Debian Stretch you can simply install Jekyll with your package manager:

```
sudo apt-get install jekyll
```

If your package manager does not provides version 3.0+ of Jekyll,
you need to install it with Gem. Therefore you need Ruby 2.0+.

```
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential
sudo gem install jekyll
```

Finally go to the root directory of the website and build it with Jekyll:

```
jekyll serve
```
